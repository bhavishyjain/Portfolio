## 💝 **Inspiration & Credits**

This portfolio builds upon the incredible foundation and inspiration from [Naresh Khatri's Portfolio](https://github.com/Naresh-Khatri/Portfolio). His innovative approach to interactive web design sparked many of the creative ideas you see here. I've expanded and customized the concept with my own unique features, animations, and personal touch.

Special thanks to the broader web development community for pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web.
